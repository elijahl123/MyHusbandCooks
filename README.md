Client SDK
You can use the @stripe/firestore-stripe-payments
JavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides
TypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client
applications would want to implement using the extension.

Use a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with
the Firebase Web SDK.

Configuring the extension
Before you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:

Cloud Firestore to store customer & subscription details.
Follow the steps in the documentation to create a Cloud Firestore database.
Firebase Authentication to enable different sign-up options for your users.
Enable the sign-in methods in the Firebase console that you want to offer your users.
Set your Cloud Firestore security rules
It is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project’s Cloud Firestore rules:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {
match /customers/{uid} {
allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;

      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;
      }
      match /subscriptions/{id} {
        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;
      }
      match /payments/{id} {
        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;
      }
    }

    match /products/{id} {
      allow read: if true;

      match /prices/{id} {
        allow read: if true;
      }

      match /tax_rates/{id} {
        allow read: if true;
      }
    }
}
}
Configure Stripe webhooks
You need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer’s subscription details.

Here’s how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:

Configure your webhook:

Go to the Stripe dashboard.

Use the URL of your extension’s function as the endpoint URL. Here’s your function’s URL: https://us-west2-my-husband-cooks.cloudfunctions.net/ext-firestore-stripe-payments-handleWebhookEvents

Select the following events:

product.created
product.updated
product.deleted
price.created
price.updated
price.deleted
checkout.session.completed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
payment_intent.processing
payment_intent.succeeded
payment_intent.canceled
payment_intent.payment_failed
tax_rate.created (optional)
tax_rate.updated (optional)
invoice.paid (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
invoice.payment_succeeded (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
invoice.payment_failed (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
invoice.upcoming (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
invoice.marked_uncollectible (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
invoice.payment_action_required (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)
Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, reconfigure your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, whsec_12345678). Enter the value in the parameter called Stripe webhook secret.

Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)
For Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the Stripe Dashboard. When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.

The extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you’d like to see support for these, please open a feature request issue with details about your business model and pricing plans.

For example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:

Product 1: Basic membership
Price 1: 10 USD per month
Price 2: 100 USD per year
Price 3: 8 GBP per month
Price 4: 80 GBP per year
[…]: additional currency and interval combinations
Product 2: Premium membership
Price 1: 20 USD per month
Price 2: 200 USD per year
Price 3: 16 GBP per month
Price 4: 160 GBP per year
[…]: additional currency and interval combinations
Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)
If you want users to get assigned a custom claim role to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a firebaseRole metadata value on the Stripe product (see screenshot).

The value you set for firebaseRole (e.g. “premium” in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim stripeRole on the user. This allows you to set specific security access rules based on the user’s roles, or limit access to certain pages. For example if you have one basic role and one premium role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {
function hasBasicSubs() {
return request.auth.token.stripeRole == "basic";
}

    function hasPremiumSubs() {
      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == "premium";
    }

    match /content-basic/{doc} {
      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();
    }
    match /content-premium/{doc} {
      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();
    }
}
}
Alternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:

async function getCustomClaimRole() {
await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);
const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();
return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;
}
Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)
Set your custom branding in the settings.
Configure the Customer Portal settings.
Toggle on “Allow customers to update their payment methods”.
Toggle on “Allow customers to update subscriptions”.
Toggle on “Allow customers to cancel subscriptions”.
Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.
Set up the required business information and links.
Using the extension
Once you’ve configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app and find the demo source code on GitHub;

Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication
The quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the FirebaseUI library. Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to ‘Sync’ new users to Stripe. If set to ‘Sync’, the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to ‘Do not sync’ (default), the extension will create the customer object “on the fly” with the first checkout session creation.

List available products and prices
Products and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:

db.collection('products')
.where('active', '==', true)
.get()
.then(function (querySnapshot) {
querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {
console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());
const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();
priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {
console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());
});
});
});
One-time payments on the web
You can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed, payment_intent.canceled, payment_intent.processing.

To create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass mode: 'payment to the Checkout Session doc creation:

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
mode: "payment",
price: "price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl", // One-time price created in Stripe
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)
One-time payments
To create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your customers/{uid}/checkout_sessions collection with the following parameters:

client: ‘mobile’
mode: ‘payment’
amount: {payment amount}
currency: {currency code}
Then listen for the extension to append paymentIntentClientSecret, ephemeralKeySecret, and customer to the doc and use these to integrate the mobile payment sheet.

Set up a payment method for future usage
You can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your customers/{uid}/checkout_sessions collection with the following parameters:

client: ‘mobile’
mode: ‘setup’
Then listen for the extension to append setupIntentClientSecret, ephemeralKeySecret, and customer to the doc and use these to integrate the mobile payment sheet.

Subscription payments (web only)
Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout
To subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the checkout_sessions collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection('checkout_sessions')
.add({
price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension
docRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {
const { error, url } = snap.data();
if (error) {
// Show an error to your customer and
// inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.
alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);
}
if (url) {
// We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.
window.location.assign(url);
}
});
Handling trials
By default, the trial period days that you’ve specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they’ve previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify trial_from_plan: false when creating the checkout session doc:

const docRef = await db
.collection("customers")
.doc(currentUser)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
price: "price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl",
trial_from_plan: false,
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes
You can create customer-facing promotion codes in the Stripe Dashboard. Refer to the docs for a detailed guide on how to set these up.

In order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set allow_promotion_codes: true when creating the checkout_sessions document:

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser)
.collection('checkout_sessions')
.add({
price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',
allow_promotion_codes: true,
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Applying promotion codes programmatically
You can set a promotion code to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.

NOTE: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don’t want to offer anymore.

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
promotion_code: "promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk",
price: "price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl",
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Automatic tax calculation with Stripe Tax
Stripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.

Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access
Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up
Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your checkout_sessions docs:
const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address
tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)
price: "price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl",
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Applying tax rates dynamically
Stripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With dynamic tax rates, you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
line_items: [
{
price: "price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5",
quantity: 1,
dynamic_tax_rates: ["txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew", "txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO", "txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi"],
},
],
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Applying static tax rates
You can collect and report taxes with Tax Rates. To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the Stripe Dashboard. When creating a new checkout_sessions document, specify the optional tax_rates list with up to five tax rate IDs:

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser)
.collection('checkout_sessions')
.add({
price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',
tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Collecting a shipping address during checkout
To collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a shipping_countries doc in your products collection. This doc needs to have a field called allowed_countries which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries here.

Secondly, you need to add collect_shipping_address: true to the Checkout Session doc creation:

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection("checkout_sessions")
.add({
collect_shipping_address: true,
price: "price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl",
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
Setting metadata on the subscription
You can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer’s subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser)
.collection('checkout_sessions')
.add({
price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
metadata: {
item: 'item001',
},
});
Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees
In addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a line_items array instead:

const docRef = await db
.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser)
.collection('checkout_sessions')
.add({
line_items: [
{
price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID
quantity: 1,
tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],
},
{
price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID
quantity: 1,
tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],
},
],
success_url: window.location.origin,
cancel_url: window.location.origin,
});
NOTE: If you specify more than one recurring price in the line_items array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the prices array. The price attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the prices array: price === prices[0].

Note that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.

Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API
Since version 0.1.7 the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the Stripe Dashboard or via Elements and the API.

In order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version 0.1.7).

Get the customer’s subscription
Subscription details are synced to the subscriptions sub-collection in the user’s corresponding customer doc.

db.collection('customers')
.doc(currentUser.uid)
.collection('subscriptions')
.where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])
.onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {
// In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.
const doc = snapshot.docs[0];
console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());
});
Redirect to the customer portal
Once a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the createPortalLink function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.

const functionRef = firebase
.app()
.functions('us-west2')
.httpsCallable('ext-firestore-stripe-payments-createPortalLink');
const { data } = await functionRef({
returnUrl: window.location.origin,
locale: "auto", // Optional, defaults to "auto"
configuration: "bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration
});
window.location.assign(data.url);
